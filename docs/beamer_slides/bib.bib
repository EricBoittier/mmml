  abstractnote = {This paper develops a Bayesian mechanics for adaptive systems.
                  Firstly, we model the interface between a system and its
                  environment with a Markov blanket. This affords conditions
                  under which states internal to the blanket encode information
                  about external states. Second, we introduce dynamics and
                  represent adaptive systems as Markov blankets at steady-state.
                  This allows us to identify a wide class of systems whose
                  internal states appear to infer external states, consistent
                  with variational inference in Bayesian statistics and
                  theoretical neuroscience. Finally, we partition the blanket
                  into sensory and active states. It follows that active states
                  can be seen as performing active inference and well-known forms
                  of stochastic control (such as PID control), which are
                  prominent formulations of adaptive behaviour in theoretical
                  biology and engineering.}

                  existence--and identification--of conditional independencies at
                  nonequilibrium steady-state. These independencies underwrite a
                  particular partition of states, in which internal states are
                  statistically secluded from external states by blanket states.
                  The existence of such partitions has interesting implications
                  for the information geometry of internal states. In brief, this
                  geometry can be read as a physics of sentience, where internal
                  states look as if they are inferring external states. However,
                  the existence of such partitions--and the functional form of
                  the underlying densities--have yet to be established. Here,
                  using the Lorenz system as the basis of stochastic chaos, we
                  leverage the Helmholtz decomposition--and polynomial
                  expansions--to parameterise the steady-state density in terms
                  of surprisal or self-information. We then show how Markov
                  blankets can be identified--using the accompanying Hessian--to
                  characterise the coupling between internal and external states
                  in terms of a generalised synchrony or synchronisation of
                  chaos. We conclude by suggesting that this kind of
                  synchronisation may provide a mathematical basis for an
                  elemental form of (autonomous or active) sentience in biology.},
